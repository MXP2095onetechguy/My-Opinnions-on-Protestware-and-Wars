# My Opinnions on Protestware and Wars

Normally Peace is the way to go (my oppinion), but if protestware such as [peacenotwar](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/peacenotwar) is a virus to protest against war, it has failed to do it's job (peace is bad) and made peace an enemy. This does not means war is the way, but let's pretend it is the way.


Feel free to disagree (if everybody agrees, I will come to all of your house, flip a table and say "You are so unanimous and it's not reliable. Ok?").
